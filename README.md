# Crowdsourced Awareness

*Description aimed for the Jury of IndiaGadgetz Hackerbay Hackathon*

## What is this all about?
We Indians love to complain. We look at the problems in our society and environment like the irresponsible garbage disposal, road pits, water logging and we complain. But we complain in an unproductive manner. Nobody hears us. To fix this somebody has to clean it up.

**Imagine, if YOU could control your city's cleanliness and make your surroundings much more habitable. This is why I've built this product.**

So, to enable you and every citizen contribute and inform the NGO + Cleanliness Drives from (High School + Colleges) + NCC + perhaps maybe even the govt (cuz of their sheer helpfulness), this web-app has been built.

## Alright, what can I do?
For the sake of simplicity:
- You can make a post describing the issue around you along with pics to support it
- Look at the problems around you in an easy-to-use Map View

Visit https://goo.gl/NyHXyO to use the live Progressive Web App.

## What happens after I post an issue? What next?
People from NGOs, Cleanliness Drive Initiators, NCCs, etc. will constantly monitor these issues and help out in these situations. They will clean up the place and post new updates and pics of the new place.

## Tech
- Polymer. Frontend. For the love of Web Components and Progressive Web Apps ^_^
- Firebase. For Realtime Database and Authentication.

## Features
- Simplicity. I am surely not the first guy with this idea. But the simplicity of the workflow is what I'm striving for.
- Mobile-first. The design is optimised heavily for mobile because this is an app that is used outside the home where a laptop cannot be used. Mobile phones are convenient... and mobile :P
- Offline-first. Outside home we usually get slow networks. So most of the static parts of the app load even while offline. Which I believe is highly necessary for network hindered country like India.

## How will you use the investment/prize from the hackathon?
Primarily, we need get in touch with all these agencies and notify sufficient number of them of our product. And to get people to use our product and scale initially, along with our product we also need to touch people's lives through Social Networks like Facebook, Twitter, etc. For example, The Ugly Indian (https://goo.gl/6vpBO8). So all this requires more legwork than softwares. Which is in my calculations the greatest worthwhile investment.

So, with advancements in tech and the strong belief in the idea, I believe this project can scale easily to millions of people and solve many problems in our city and many others. And this idea also has many business models to it too. Which is why I believe I should be the one to win this hackathon and get invested in. So I kindly ask you too to please support this idea and make this 24 hour minimum viable product become a reality.
