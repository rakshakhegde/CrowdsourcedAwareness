# Crowdsourced Awareness
## What is this all about?
We Indians love to complain. We look at the problems in our society and environment like the irresponsible garbage disposal, road pits, water logging and we complain. But we complain in an unproductive manner. Nobody hears us. To fix this somebody has to clean it up.

**Imagine, if YOU could control your city's cleanliness and make your surroundings much more habitable. This is why I've built this product.**

So, to enable you and every citizen contribute and inform the NGO + Cleanliness Drives from (High School + Colleges) + NCC + perhaps maybe even the govt (cuz of their sheer helpfulness), this web-app has been built.

## Alright, what can I do?
For the sake of simplicity:
- You can make a post describing the issue around you along with pics to support it
- Look at the problems around you in an easy-to-use Map View
